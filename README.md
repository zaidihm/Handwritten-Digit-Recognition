# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

🖊️ Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN

📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model learns to classify digits (0-9) through deep learning techniques and is evaluated on multiple performance metrics.

🔥 Features
Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset
Trains a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers
Uses softmax activation for multi-class classification
Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Visualizes misclassified digits and confusion matrices

📊 Dataset Information
Dataset: MNIST (60,000 training & 10,000 test images)
Images: 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9)
Labels: Corresponding numeric digit (0-9)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn

📊 Model Performance
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score evaluation
Confusion matrix visualization
Predicted vs. Actual images for analysis

🔮 Future Enhancements
Implement data augmentation to improve generalization
Experiment with pretrained CNN models for better accuracy
Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
